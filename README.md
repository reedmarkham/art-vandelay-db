## ðŸŽ¨ art-vandelay-db

This project is an AWS CDK application designed to deploy an Amazon OpenSearch Service domain, configured for storing and querying image embeddings generated by `art-vandelay`. It also deploys an S3 bucket for general usage.

It uses AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage OpenSearch credentials and provisions all necessary resources using infrastructure-as-code (AWS CDK).
